# SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification SoSe24
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/siim-isic-melanoma-classification

This is a student project I did for university.
This model has an accuracy of about 60% in Kaggle.
This model uses the JPEG Dataset, as I couldnt figure out how to work with tfrecords or dicom, and a CNN.

If you have to do something similar feel free to use my code, no need to credit me but please message me if you are using it (anonomously preferably)

My professor literally threw me into cold water with this one, so please excuse me not following best practices.

The comments are in german so use deepl or just mail me if you have questions.
I wouldn't mind if I you could send me your results as I'd would like to improve or learn from it.
