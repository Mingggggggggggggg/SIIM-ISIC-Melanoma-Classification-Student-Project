# SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification SoSe24
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/siim-isic-melanoma-classification

This is a student project I did for university.
This model has an accuracy of about 60% in Kaggle and uses the JPEG Dataset provided by Kaggle and a Convolutional Neural Network, as I couldnt figure out how to work with tfrecords or dicom. On later iterations I would have used resnet or effnet but I wanted to design my own Neural Network.

If you have to do something similar feel free to use my code.

PS: You need to use python 3.9.19 (on Windows) if you want to use your GPU.
